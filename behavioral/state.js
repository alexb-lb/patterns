/**
 * State pattern
 *
 * It is a behavioural design pattern that allows an object to alter its behaviour based on changes to its internal state.
 * The object returned by a State pattern class seems to change its class. It provides state-specific logic to a
 * limited set of objects in which each object type represents a particular state.
